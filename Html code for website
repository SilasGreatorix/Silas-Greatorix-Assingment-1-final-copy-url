	<h4><u>Personal Profile</u></h4>
	<p>My name is Silas Greatorix, I am 17 years old and have just enrolled into the Introduction to programming and the Introduction to Information Technology courses at RMIT University. I currently live in Murwillumbah, NSW with my family. Having never participated in any form of programming or IT courses, I expect the next 11 weeks to be a challenge and a fantastic kickstart into the world of IT.
<br>

I was born in Wodonga, Vic in 2004 and have lived most of my life in NE Victoria. I attended a very small primary school, which is where My love of history and language was born. Over my 12 years of schooling, I have been taught three languages other than English but have only been able to properly remember two: German and Italian. Other than learning languages, one of my favorite pastimes is listening to educational podcasts, either while going for a walk or when I’m going to sleep, they always keep me entertained.</p>
    
	<h4><u>erest In It</u></h4>
    <p>I first became interested in 2011, when I was given a Wii by my mother. Previous to 2011 my only experience with IT was the use of PowerPoint and Word. And whilst I wouldn’t know what I would do without these applications now, they were excruciatingly boring to me as a child. After getting the Wii, however, I was entranced by the worlds I was being transported to, it was after I turned on my first gaming console that I knew, I wanted to work in the field of IT.
<br>
	When looking for online courses, I was not particular in my choice of university. I enrolled into my current courses through OUA (Open Universities Australia). However, If I had the ability to return to when I was browsing courses, I would ensure that the course I enter was provided for by RMIT. 
<br>
In this course I expected to learn the basics of IT and what it would mean to work in the field if IT. Learning aspects such as legality and ethics of the internet and its usage were also aspects I expected to learn about. </p>

<h4><u>Ideal Job</u></h4>

<h4> Link to Ideal Job and Title: Cyber Security Anaylist. https://www.seek.com.au/job/56232786?type=promoted#sol=127a188d86c7123f078fa8b6f950157fdefd0e62</h4>

<p>The role of the potential applicant for this position would be responsible for the: upkeep, development and implementation of cyber security methods. With the central aim of protecting the company’s technological information and assets. The role requires that the applicant work effectively in a team but are still capable of working alone. This role/profession is particularly attractive to me as it encompasses all areas of my many interests. As I am today my interests involve: Law and crime prevention, Psychology, Technology and problem solving. The role of a Cyber security analyst recognizes all of these topics to a degree and births a single profession out of them.
<br>
The role requires a candidate with a background in information security areas, such as: Endpoint Security, Network Security, Data loss prevention and incident response. It is advised that you have a tertiary qualification with 5 years of experience in information security.
<br>
You are required to be a conscientious learner with a strong sense of determination. You will need to be able to work in groups as well as on your own, ensuring you always put in your best effort.
Currently I do not have the qualifications to apply to this role. I currently hold only a pass of year 11. However, I am currently on course to being able to study some of the required/desirable qualifications mentioned in the add. In order to be a successful candidate for a position such as this one, I would need to complete my current two courses (Introduction to programming and Introduction to Information Technology). After completing my two current courses, I would complete a degree in computer science. Then completing Cyber Security and Information Security courses would be the final leg of my educational journey. </p>'

<h4><u>Personal Profile</u></h4>
<u>personality results obtained through the Myers-Briggs test</u>
<br>
Personality type: Advocate (INFJ-T)
<br>
Traits: Introverted – 82%, Intuitive – 62%, Feeling – 51%, Judging – 72%, 
<br>
Turbulent – 79%
<br>
Role: Diplomat
<br>
Strategy: Constant Improvement
<br>
<u>personality results obtained through The Big Five: My personality test.</u>
Openness to experience – medium 
<br>
Extraversion – medium
<br>
Neuroticism – low
<br>
Conscientiousness – low 
<br>
Agreeableness – high
<br>
<u>learning preference obtained through VARK Questionnaire</u>
<br>
My learning preference is – Multimodal 
<br>
<br>
	<p>Looking at the above results, I am conflicted as to which test, I should pay more attention. There are discrepancies in the results made obvious by the fact that they contradict each other. However, online psychological tests are never perfect and are normally only capable of grasping the surface layer of your personality. The results show that I am an agreeable person but as can be seen in the results from the Myers-Briggs test, I often tend to try and complete work on my own, even if it is a group project or assignment. This might mean that when working in a team or attempting to form a team I might work better with people more extraverted. This way we will be able to maintain a balance of group work and solo work. The worst possible thing to do when looking to form a group is place introverts with other introverts.</p>
    
<h4><u>Project Idea</u></h4>
<h4>Counter Box</h4>

	<p>Counter Box is a small and magnetic device that can be placed on the fridge, on the counter or wherever you may want it. Counter box acts as a home cyber security hub and as a display center concerning information, such as: Data usage and availability (For homes using satellite for internet connection) and number of devices within the household using/on nefarious connections or accessing malicious websites. This device will make maintaining/conserving limited data supply easy.</p>
    
<h4>Motivation</h4>

	<p>There are hundreds of thousands of businesses and homes across the world where Counter Box could make life, just that much easier. The Counter Box will be most useful in Hotels and Motels with limited internet, as it will give guests a visual representation of how much data they have used and how much they have left. I know from personal experience that a device such as this would be perfect for people who live where they only have accesses to limited data or only have access to the internet at certain times of the day or night.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

	<p>Counter Box is a small device roughly the size of an iPhone 12 or 14.7 cm by 7.7 cm. On the back it will have a magnet allowing the user to place the device anywhere in their home or business. On the front of the device there will be screen displaying information such as, how much household data is there, how many devices are connected to the network, internet and download speed, as well as potential threats.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Counter Box’s main feature is its ability to give a visual representation of how much data a household or business has. But it also acts as a firewall protecting the house from useless scams, such as: scam emails, malware and spyware. The device does this by preventing connected devices like phones, computers and tablets from accessing any potentially malicious sites. To monitor online activity, all online traffic is routed through the Counter box and checked via DNS filtering. This will give parents, care givers or organizations the ability to easily change and make corrections to what can and cannot be viewed if they would like more freedom, this ability caters more to use in the business sector rather than in the home.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Similarly, to the ALDI Mobile app, The Counter Box will give updates on internet usage in real-time. The programing language that would be used to run and operate the device would be Python. Python is one of the most popular programing languages for data display because of its simplicity and its ability to be effective in a variety of areas such as, Machine learning and Artificial intelligence.</p>
    
<h4>Tools and mechanisms</h4>

	<p>The device will act similarly to programs and apps used by internet provider companies such as, Telstra and Optus. The device will hold information concerning the online cost of each task the users complete. After 10 minutes, the device will calculate the total number of online tasks completed and deduct the amount of data used form the total amount available. To ensure the online safety of the users, the device will use DNS filtering, which can be easily set up by the user to block potentially.</p>
    
<h4>Skills required</h4>

	<p>It is completely unrealistic that a person could attempt to create a device such as this one without high-level qualifications and partners/team members. There are numerous areas in the design of the device that would require multiple skillsets and abilities. For the devices set up and code you would require Data scientists and machine learning engineers to develop the code for the devise to properly function. The hardware for the device will be the least challenging aspect as there are countless other devices that have a similar design and method.</p>

<h4>Outcome</h4>

	<p>If the project were to be successful, it would make life easier by displaying information in a accessible location without having to remember passwords or open 15 tabs. This device is a mostly a quality-of-life upgrade. It would likely be most useful in businesses and in homes that require satellite connection. The device has no real effect on the perpetuation of technology and programming.</p>
